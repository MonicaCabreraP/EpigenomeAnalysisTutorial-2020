Welcome to the Epigenomics tutorial documentation!
==================================================

If you are taking part in our tutorial, then you find the information here that you need.
The documentation is split up into 4 parts. Make sure to read and follow the `**What you need part** <https://epigenomeanalysistutorial-2020.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html>`_ with all necessary **Installations** before you join us virtually. Below you can see an illustration of the workflow we planned for you.
