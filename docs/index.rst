Welcome to the Epigenomics tutorial documentation!
==================================================

If you are taking part in our `tutorial  <https://eccb2020.info/ntbt04-keeping-up-with-epigenomic-analysis-theory-and-practice/>`_, then you find the information here that you need.
The documentation is split up into 4 parts.
